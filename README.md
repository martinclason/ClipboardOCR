# ClipboardOCR

## Getting started
- Install homebrew www.brew.sh
- Install tesseract-lang with `brew install tesseract-lang`
- Install pngpaste with `brew install pngpaste`
- Run install script `install.sh`

## Using script
Copy the image you want to transform to text with the bulit in CMD-SHIFT-4 shortcut in MacOS that stores the resulting image in the clipboard.
Go to a terminal window and type `clipboard_ocr` and hit enter. The clipboard will now contain the text instead and this can be pasted like normal. If you want to do OCR on swedish text use the command `clipboard_ocr_sv` instead.
